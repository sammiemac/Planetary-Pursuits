    "{i}Who would have thought Pluto could leave such an impression; a shy, pale-skinned girl who could float was something out of a fantasy visual novel.{/i}"

    "{i}I still can’t believe there are 8 more planets like her. I’m not sure I could handle meeting even one more---{/i}"

    "Before I finish my thought, I am interrupted by an upbeat chirpy voice from behind me."

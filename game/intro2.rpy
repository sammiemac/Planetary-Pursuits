    "{i}So, here I am, the lobby…{/i}"

    "It’s not the first time I’ve been here. I remember coming here and taking an elevator up to the second or third floor, answering some questions from an interviewer in some room, and then taking my leave. The whole process was a blur to me, so it was even more bewildering when the acceptance email came in a few weeks later."

    "{i}No way they take in some kid just based on the fact that they worked on the Astroplacation Project…{/i}"

    "The lobby is the same as it was before: clean, spacious, and well air-conditioned. I appreciated that last quality when I came here in the summer, but now that it’s fall it’s much less welcoming."

    theo "God damn, this lobby is cold."

    "He rubs his arms then gestures for me to follow him. We eventually reach an elevator and head inside, where he presses a series of numbers on the number pad, one that appears to have the numbers 1-12, excluding the number 8. Two glass panels next to the number pad reveal themselves, as Theo lays his hand on one and lifts his sunglasses to look directly into the other. A red light scans both as the elevator doors close shut."

    "Elevator" "Floor 8."

    theo "Planets ain’t waitin’ for us or anything– Though, uh, as much as I wish I didn’t need to say it right now, RWJ hopes to keep everything on schedule."

    mc "Huh?"

    "The response is involuntary as the news steals the air from my lungs."

    "{i}When I saw “President” in the email communications, I thought they meant the President of ISAAC, not Renee Whitaker Jiang, President of the United States…{/i}"

    theo "Yeah. I’m, uh, legally obligated to remind you of that part. I’ll be giving her progress reports, that sort of thing."

    menu:
        "\"Got it. Anything else?\"":
            theo "Nothing I’m legally bound to say. We’re kind of charting new territory here, so it’s up to you to set the standard. Just... handle it how you think you should. ISAAC didn’t choose you for nothin’."
        "\"Honestly, Theo? I had no idea...\"":
            theo "I get it. Government communications are a lot vaguer than I thought they would be going into this job. I guess this whole communicating with planets thing is... a shot in the dark for everyone involved."
        "{i}Stay silent.{/i}":
            mc "..."
    
    "It’s silent for the rest of the elevator ride."

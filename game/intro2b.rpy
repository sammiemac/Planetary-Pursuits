    pluto "O-oh, this?"

    "She begins to levitate ever so slightly."

    show pluto shy

    pluto "W-We can all do that. The planets. Neptune and Uranus a-and Saturn and Jupiter, they can become sort of intangible, too. B-but Earth told us not to do that kind of thing if we were down here, s-so I’m sorry about that..."

    show pluto flustered

    "I can’t help but laugh."

    mc "No, no, it’s okay. I actually thought it was kind of cool."

    show pluto shy

    pluto "Well, it’s not that cool, I guess it’s kind of like... like, walking for you guys."

    mc "Just because it’s normal for you doesn’t mean it’s not impressive to us."

    "Pluto shrugs."

    pluto "I’m sure there are things that you guys do that would be cool to us but not to you."

    mc "Probably."

    "I sit down on the chair and think for a little bit."

    menu:
        "\"We make beautiful art.\"":

            mc "Like paintings, books, and music. Things that introduce images or feelings or sounds that you yourself could never have imagined, ones you would have never even known existed until you came across them."

            show pluto neutral

            "Pluto nods, seeming to put some genuine thought into my words."

            pluto "That sounds cool. I guess Earth itself could be art in a way like that. I never imagined life would ever be a real thing until I saw her. And with all that color, the white the blue and green..."

        "\"We domesticate animals.\"":

            mc "Dogs and cats and stuff like that. They’re like, furry little animals you can nourish and take care of and watch them grow up, like having a kid."

            show pluto neutral

            "Pluto nods, looking upwards towards the ceiling. Her expression is indifferent as she looks back towards me."

            pluto "That sounds like Saturn with all of her moons. Except her moons aren’t furry. Or little. And they... never mind... "

            show pluto shy

            "She looks away, almost as if she was about to say something embarrassing."

            mc "I mean, it’s not the part of them being furry that matters, just that they’re something you take care of, something that you love that loves you back."

            "I’m met with a shrug."

            pluto "Mhm. I have moons too. We just don’t talk, or at least not the way Saturn does with her moons."

        "\"We play video games.\"":

            mc "Like, really cool ones. Ones that can make you feel like you’re in a whole different world, with different people, ones that put people to the test with other people to see who can press buttons faster or know the game better, give you experiences you couldn’t have otherwise."

            show pluto neutral

            "Pluto nods, but tilts her head midway through my explanation."

            pluto "Really? I’ve never heard of those... That sounds kind of... scary... The only games I know are the ones Saturn plays with her moons... You know, I always thought they were so little from how Saturn talked about them, but some of them are bigger than me..."

        "\"We build really big buildings.\"":

            mc "Ones that go way, way high. Way higher than
            this building, and way higher than like a
            dozen of these buildings. The tallest ones
            are called skyscrapers for a reason."

            show pluto neutral

            "Pluto nods."

            pluto "Earth has told us about those. Some of them you can see if you get close enough to her. But th-that’s just what Mars said, I was too scared of Earth to get that close to her."

        "\"I can’t think of anything right now...\"":

            mc "I guess it’s just hard to think about."

            "{i}It’s not really a question I had prepared for either... Never in my whole life, did I ever think that I would be talking to someone who is functionally an alien. Let alone having them ask me about what we, humanity, could do.{/i}"

            pluto "S-sorry, I probably made you... feel uncomfortable there..."

            mc "No, you’re fine. Don’t worry about it."

            "There’s a few seconds of silence."
    
    mc "The other planets, you interact with them a lot?"

    show pluto shy

    "Pluto appears to think for a while, then looks towards me with a shrug."

    pluto "You could say that. They’re not... friends, I don’t think, but they’re all... All we have out there is each other."

    mc "I see..."

    pluto "Sorry, th-that makes it sound depressing. It’s really not... I just... made it sound worse than... than it really is. They’re nice. Maybe not the most... pleasant company sometimes, but I’m glad they’re there."

    "Her more contemplative face curls into a small smile as her thoughts seem to wander. The smile quickly disappears, however, as her glasses fog up and she looks away."

    pluto "I’m just not as... not as good at talking or whatever as some of the other planets. A-and that’s especially... especially for someone I’ve never met."

    "I nod before getting an idea in my head, turning on like a lightbulb."

    mc "Well, we could... get to know each other more, if you wanted to. Probably outside of this box, though."

    show pluto flustered

    "Pluto looks around before looking back towards me."

    pluto "O-oh, well, I uh... Jupiter said that this was just going to be a short introduction... A-and Neptune, she wanted to stop by too, so maybe not now... I should be free by my next rotation, though..."

    "{i}Pluto’s rotation, that must be her way of saying a day in her time.{/i}"

    mc "How does four-fifths of a rotation from now sound to you? I’ll... send a message out to you and let you in with the Astroplacation device when it’s time."

    "{i}That should be about noon, five days from now.{/i}"

    "The machine roars to life as I say that, drowning out my words a little bit. Eventually, the roar becomes a drone, then the drone becomes a hum, and then the hum becomes silence."

    "I look around. I’m alone in the room."

    "That is, until..."
